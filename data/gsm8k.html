<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, so Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Let me figure out how many that is first. A dozen is 12, right? So 2 dozen would be 12 times 2. Let me do the math: 12 x 2 = 24. So Mimi has 24 seashells.</p>
<p>Then Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi had 24, Kyle has 2 times that. That's 24 x 2 = 48. So Kyle has 48 seashells.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Kyle's 48 seashells divided by three would be Leigh's number of shells. Let me calculate that: 48 ÷ 3 = 16. So Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Mimi's original 24, Kyle has twice that, which is 48, then Leigh takes one-third of Kyle's 48. 48 divided by 3 is indeed 16. Yeah, that seems right.</p>
<p>Hmm, just to be thorough, maybe I can list out the steps again. Step 1: Mimi's shells = 2 dozen = 24. Kyle has twice as much: 24 x 2 = 48. Leigh takes one-third of Kyle's: 48 / 3 = 16. Yep, that all checks out.</p>
<p>I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The key was multiplying Mimi's number by 2 for Kyle and then dividing Kyle's by 3 for Leigh. The order of operations is straightforward here, just multiplication and division. So no mistakes detected.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. A dozen is 12, so:<br />
[<br />
2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24<br />
]</p>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so:<br />
[<br />
2 \times 24 = 48<br />
]</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, so:<br />
[<br />
\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16<br />

<p>Thus, Leigh had (\boxed{16}) seashells.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Hmm, a dozen is 12, right? So 2 dozen would be 2 times 12, which is 24. Got that part. Then Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, then Kyle has 2 times 24. Let me calculate that: 2 * 24 is 48. So Kyle has 48 seashells.</p>
<p>Now, Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So first, I need to figure out how many shells are in Kyle's total. That's 48 from before. Taking one-third of that means Leigh gets 48 divided by 3. Let me do the division: 48 ÷ 3 is 16. So Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me double-check that. Mimi had 24, Kyle has twice as much, so 2*24=48. Then one-third of Kyle's is 48/3=16. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I messed up any steps here.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it: 2 dozen is 24, Kyle has twice that, so 24*2=48. Then Leigh takes a third of 48, which is 16. Yep, same answer both times. So Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since a dozen is 12, (2 \text{ dozens} = 2 \times 12 = 24) seashells. </p>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so Kyle's total is (2 \times 24 = 48) seashells.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. Therefore, Leah's total is (\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16) seashells.</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Hmm, first I need to figure out how many that is. A dozen is 12, right? So 2 dozen would be 2 times 12. Let me calculate that. 2 multiplied by 12 is 24 seashells. So Mimi has 24 shells.</p>
<p>Then it says Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, then Kyle would have 2 times that. That's 48 shells. Okay, so Kyle has 48 seashells.</p>
<p>Next part: Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Kyle has 48, and Leigh takes one-third of that. Let me do the division here. A third of 48 is... well, dividing 48 by 3. Let me think, 3 times 16 is 48, because 3<em>10=30 and 3</em>6=18, so 30+18=48. So one-third of Kyle's shells is 16. Therefore, Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. Mimi: 2 dozen = 24, Kyle: twice that is 48, Leigh: one-third of 48 is 16. That seems right.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of groups? Like, Mimi has 2 dozen, which is 24. Then Kyle has twice as many, so adding another 48 makes him have 72 total? Wait, no. Wait, actually, when they say "twice as many," does that mean the same number plus twice? So if Mimi has 24, Kyle has 24 + (2*24) which would be 48. So yes, that's correct.</p>
<p>Then Leigh takes one-third of Kyle's total shells. So all of Kyle's 48 is split into thirds, so each third is 16. That seems consistent.</p>
<p>I think that's right. Let me check again step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi: 2 dozen = 24.</li>
<li>Kyle: Twice as many as Mimi = 48.</li>
<li>Leigh: One-third of Kyle's shells = 16.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yep, all the steps check out. So Leigh must have 16 seashells.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since a dozen is 12, she has:<br />
[<br />
2 \times 12 = 24<br />
]<br />
Therefore, Mimi picked up 24 seashells.</p>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. Since Mimi has 24, Kyle found:<br />
[<br />
2 \times 24 = 48<br />
]<br />
So Kyle picked up 48 seashells.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. A third of 48 is:<br />
[<br />
\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16<br />

Thus, Leigh had:<br />

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Hmm, a dozen is 12, so 2 dozen would be 24 seashells, right? Because 1 times 12 is 12, and 2 times 12 is 24. So Mimi has 24 shells.</p>
<p>Then Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, then twice that would be 2 times 24. Let me calculate that: 2*24 is 48. So Kyle has 48 shells.</p>
<p>Next, Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So we need to find out how many shells Kyle has, which is 48, and then take one-third of that. So a third of 48 is 48 divided by 3. Let me do that division: 48 ÷ 3 equals 16. So Leigh has 16 shells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Mimi starts with 24, Kyle has twice that, which is 48. Then Leigh takes one-third of 48, which is 16. That seems right. Hmm, double-checking the steps: dozen to number, multiplication by 2 for Kyle, division by 3 for Leigh. Yep, that all adds up.</p>
<p>So the answer should be 16 seashells. Let me just confirm once more. Mimi:24, Kyle:48, Leigh:16. Yep, that seems correct. No decimals or fractions involved here, so it's straightforward multiplication and division. Okay, confident with that.</think></p>
<p>Mimi initially collected 2 dozen = 24 seashells. Kyle found twice as many, which is ( 2 \times 24 = 48 ). Leigh then took one-third of Kyle's shells, so ( \frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16 ).</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let me see. The problem is about Mimi picking up some seashells, Kyle finding twice as many, and Leigh taking one-third of what Kyle found. I need to figure out how many seashells Leigh has in total.</p>
<p>First, let me parse the information given. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen would be 2 times 12. Let me calculate that first. 2 multiplied by 12 is 24. So Mimi has 24 seashells.</p>
<p>Next, Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So Kyle's number of seashells would be 2 times Mimi's. That would be 24 multiplied by 2, which is 48. So Kyle has 48 shells.</p>
<p>Then, Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Leigh's seashells would be a third of 48. Let me compute that. A third of 48 is... well, 3 goes into 48 how many times? 3 times 16 is 48. So Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Mimi has 24, Kyle has twice that, which is 48. Then Leigh takes one-third of the shells Kyle found, so 48 divided by 3 is indeed 16. That seems right.</p>
<p>But let me go through the problem again step by step to ensure there's no misinterpretation. The key points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mimi: 2 dozen.</li>
<li>
<p>Convert to number of shells: 24.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kyle found twice as many as Mimi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Kyle's shells: 24 * 2 = 48.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells Kyle found.</p>
</li>
<li>So Leigh's shells: 48 / 3 = 16.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything adds up. Mimi has fewer, Kyle more, Leigh less than Kyle but still more than Mimi. The calculations check out. I think that's correct.</p>
<p>But let me consider if there's any alternative interpretation. For example, sometimes "twice as many" can be confused with double the number. But in this case, since Kyle found twice as many as Mimi, who has 24, that's definitely 48. Then Leigh taking one-third of Kyle's would be a standard fraction division.</p>
<p>No, I don't see any issues here. The answer should be 16. Let me just recount to make sure I didn't transpose any numbers.</p>
<p>Mimi: 24, Kyle: 48. Half of that is 24, so Leigh has 16. Yep. That's consistent.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe if someone thought that Kyle found twice as many as Mimi per day or something, but the problem doesn't specify any time frame. It just says "found twice as many shells." So it's straightforward multiplication.</p>
<p>I think that's solid. The answer is 16 seashells.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
\boxed{16}</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is calculated as follows:<br />
[<br />
2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24<br />
]</p>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so:<br />
[<br />
2 \times 24 = 48<br />
]</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, which is calculated as follows:<br />
[<br />
\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16<br />
]</p>
<p>Thus, Leigh had (\boxed{16}) seashells.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Hmm, a dozen is 12, so 2 dozens would be 24 shells, right? Then Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, doubling that would be 48 shells. But wait, let me double-check. The problem says Kyle found twice as many as Mimi. Yeah, so 2 times 24 is 48. That seems right.</p>
<p>Then Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So after Kyle found his 48, Leigh takes one-third of that number. One-third is 3/12 or maybe simplifying to a whole number, which would be 4 because 48 divided by 3 is 16. Wait, no. Let me think again. One-third of 48. So 1/3 is approximately 0.333, so 40% of 48 is 16. So Leigh would have 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me confirm. If Mimi has 24, Kyle has twice that, so 48. Then Leigh takes one-third of 48, which is indeed 16. So Leigh has 16 seashells. That seems correct.</p>
<p>But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The question says Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So yes, after Kyle's 48, one third is 16. So Leigh has 16. Yeah, that seems right.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe I can check by plugging back into the problem. If Mimi has 24, Kyle has twice that: 48. Then one-third of 48 is 16. So Leigh has 16. All the steps check out. I don't think there's any mistake here.</p>
<p>So the answer should be 16 shells.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells, which is (2 \times 12 = 24) shells. Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so he found (2 \times 24 = 48) shells. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, which is (\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16) shells.</p>
<p>Thus, Leigh had (\boxed{16}) seashells.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. The problem is about Mimi, Kyle, and Leigh collecting seashells. I need to figure out how many seashells Leigh ended up with based on the number each person collected. </p>
<p>First, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.</p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Hmm, a dozen is 12, right? So 2 dozen would be 2 times 12. Let me calculate that: 2 * 12 = 24. So Mimi has 24 seashells.</p>
<p>Then, Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, then Kyle would have 2 times that. Let's compute that: 2 * 24 = 48. So Kyle has 48 seashells.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Leigh is taking one third of Kyle's 48 seashells. Therefore, Leigh should have (1/3) * 48. Let me do that division: 48 divided by 3 is 16. So Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me check if I did each step correctly. </p>
<p>Starting with Mimi: 2 dozen is indeed 24. Then double that for Kyle, which gives 48. Leigh takes one third of 48, which is 16. That seems straightforward.</p>
<p>Is there any chance I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers? Let me double-check. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 24. Twice as many as Mimi would be double that: 24 * 2 = 48. Then one third of Kyle's shells is 1/3 of 48, which is 16. Yes, that all adds up.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the question was worded differently? Let me read it again. "Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found." So yes, Kyle has 48, Leigh takes a third of that. </p>
<p>No, I don't think there's any trick here. The numbers are straightforward: multiplication and division. So Leigh has 16.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
Leigh had a total of \boxed{16} seashells.</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since a dozen is 12, we calculate:<br />
[ 2 \times 12 = 24 ]</p>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so:<br />
[ 2 \times 24 = 48 ]</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, which is:<br />
[ \frac{1}{3} \times 48 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 ]</p>
<p>Thus, Leigh had a total of \boxed{16} seashells.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach.  Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi and put them in his pocket. Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found.  How many seashells did Leigh have?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells on the beach. Hmm, first I need to figure out how many that is in total. A dozen is 12, right? So 2 dozen would be 2 times 12. Let me write that down: 2 * 12 = 24. So Mimi has 24 seashells.</p>
<p>Then, Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So if Mimi has 24, double that would be 2 * 24 = 48. Kyle ends up with 48 seashells.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Leigh is taking 1/3 of 48. Let me calculate that: 48 divided by 3. Hmm, 48 divided by 3 is 16. So Leigh has 16 seashells.</p>
<p>Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Mimi's 2 dozen is definitely 24, Kyle twice that is 48, one-third of 48 is indeed 16. Yeah, that seems right.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. If 2 dozen is 24, then each doze is 12. So for Kyle, who found twice as many as Mimi, that would be 2 * 12 = 24. Then Leigh takes a third of Kyle's 24, which is 8. But wait, no, that contradicts my previous answer because 1/3 of 24 is 8. Wait a minute, now I'm confused.</p>
<p>Hold on, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me go through it again step by step.</p>
<p>First, Mimi has 2 dozen seashells. Since a dozen is 12, 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24.</p>
<p>Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi. So Kyle's shells = 2 * Mimi's shells = 2 * 24 = 48.</p>
<p>Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found. So Leigh's shells = (1/3) * Kyle's shells = (1/3) * 48 = 16. So that's the same answer as before.</p>
<p>But if I consider another approach: If each shell is 1 seashell, then Mimi has 24, Kyle has 48. Then Leigh taking a third would be 48 / 3 = 16. So that's the same.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe converting dozens into individual shells as units: a dozen is 12 seashells. So Mimi has 2<em>12=24. Kyle has twice that, which is 24</em>2=48. Then a third of 48 is indeed 16.</p>
<p>So why did I think Leigh would have 8 earlier? Because if I thought of the number as 24 instead of 48, but that's because I confused Mimi and Kyle. So no, the correct answer is 16.</p>
<p>Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me check again. If Kyle found twice as many as Mimi, and Mimi has 24, then Kyle has 2*24=48. Then Leigh takes one-third of that: 48/3=16. So 16 is correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, the answer should be 16 seashells. Leigh has 16.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.</think></p>
<p>Mimi picked up 2 dozen seashells. Since a dozen is 12, Mimi has:<br />
[<br />
2 \times 12 = 24<br />
]<br />
Kyle found twice as many shells as Mimi, so Kyle has:<br />
[<br />
2 \times 24 = 48<br />
]<br />
Leigh grabbed one-third of the shells that Kyle found, which is:<br />
[<br />
\frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16<br />
]<br />
Thus, Leigh had \boxed{16} seashells.&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Frankie has different types of pets: snakes, cats, parrots, dogs, and some unspecified ones with four legs. The problem says he has six more snakes than cats, one less parrot than cats, and six of his pets have four legs. He also has two dogs. We need to find the total number of pets he has.</p>
<p>First, let's list out all the given information step by step. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Frankie has six more snakes than cats. So, if I let the number of cats be C, then the number of snakes would be C + 6. But wait, this might not be possible if C is already higher than some other number? Hmm, maybe we need to consider that the number of cats can't be negative, but since it's Frankie's pets, presumably he has at least a couple of each. But let's just keep it as C + 6 for now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats. So, if the number of cats is C, then the number of parrots would be C - 1. That's straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six of his pets have four legs, which means they are dogs. He has 2 dogs, so that checks out: 6 pets with four legs and 2 dogs. So all the unspecified four-legged pets are dogs, which is fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, we need to figure out how many cats and snakes there are. Let's denote the number of cats as C, then snakes would be C + 6, parrots would be C - 1. The total number of pets is then: C (cats) + (C + 6) (snakes) + (C - 1) (parrots) + 2 dogs. So the total number of pets is C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2. Let me compute that: combining like terms, that's 3C + 7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wait, so the total number of pets is 3C + 7. But we need to find C, right? To find the total pets, we might not necessarily need C. Wait, maybe not. Let's see.</p>
<p>But the problem is asking for the total number of pets he has in total, which would be 3C + 7. But that seems like we need to know C. However, maybe there's information missing? Wait, no, actually, the problem might require that we don't need to find C individually because maybe 3C + 7 must equal a certain number. Wait, but how?</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps there's another constraint we can apply here. Let me check again.</p>
<p>Wait, the problem mentions "six of his pets have four legs," which we've accounted for by dogs. But maybe there's another consideration? Let me think. The problem states that he has six more snakes than cats, so if C is the number of cats, then snakes are C + 6. The parrots are one less than the cats: C - 1.</p>
<p>Then, the total number of pets is:</p>
<p>Cats + Snakes + Parrots + Dogs = 3C - 1 (since C - 1 parrots, and the rest are cats and snakes). But wait, that would be C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2. So that's 3C + 7.</p>
<p>But how do we find C? The problem doesn't give us a specific number for the pets, so maybe there's something missing here? Wait, but perhaps we don't need to find C individually. Let me read the problem again.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe there's a missing piece here. The problem says Frankie has pets: snakes, cats, parrots, dogs, and unspecified four-legged. The six with four legs are dogs. Wait, but if he has 2 dogs already, that's accounted for.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps the total number of pets is 3C + 7, but since Frankie's parents let him have many pets, the number must be a positive integer. But unless there's another constraint, this could be any positive integer C such that 3C +7 is a valid number of pets. However, the problem must have a unique answer, so perhaps I made a mistake here.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me check the problem statement again:</p>
<p>"Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?"</p>
<p>So, the six four-legged pet are dogs: 2. So total pets = C (cats) + S (snakes) + P (parrots) + 2 dogs. And the relationships S = C +6, P = C -1.</p>
<p>So total pets = C + (C +6) + (C -1) + 2 = 3C +7.</p>
<p>But unless there's a missing piece, like maybe the total number of pets must be an integer and maybe more constraints. Wait, but unless there's a numerical answer expected here, perhaps the problem is missing something? Hmm.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe I misread. Let's check again: "Six of his pets have four legs." So six out of how many? The problem doesn't specify the total number of his pets. Wait, but wait, isn't the question asking for the total number of pets he has in total? So maybe the answer is 3C +7, but we need to find C such that all pet counts are positive integers.</p>
<p>But since Frankie's parents let him have many pets, presumably there are multiple of each. Let me think: if we can find the value of C such that S, P, and Dogs are all positive integers. But since he has 2 dogs already, that's fixed.</p>
<p>So let's write S = C +6 ≥1 (since he has at least one snake), P = C -1 ≥0, and Dogs=2.</p>
<p>So we have S = C +6 ≥1 =&gt; C ≥ -5 (which is always true). P = C -1 ≥0 =&gt; C ≥1.</p>
<p>So combining these, the smallest possible value for C is 1. Then:</p>
<p>C =1</p>
<p>S=7</p>
<p>P=0 (invalid, because parrots can't be zero)</p>
<p>So C=1 gives P=0, which is invalid. So we need to find the next integer where C -1 ≥0 =&gt; C≥1, and S=C +6 ≥1.</p>
<p>So for C=1: P=0 invalid</p>
<p>C=2: S=8, P=1. So that's okay.</p>
<p>C=3: S=9, P=2</p>
<p>So possible values of C are integers ≥1. So the total number of pets would be 3C +7 = 14 (for C=2), 21 (C=3). But the problem asks for "how many pets does he have in total?" So unless there is a specific number, these are the possible totals. But since the problem doesn't specify any other constraints, maybe there's a mistake here.</p>
<p>Wait, but in the original problem statement, Frankie's parents let him have many pets. It might be implied that all pet counts are non-negative, but perhaps we need to consider the minimal total number. But again, without additional information, how can we determine the exact number?</p>
<p>Wait a second, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.</p>
<p>He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs (which is two dogs). So total pets would be C + S + P + 2, with S = C +6 and P = C -1.</p>
<p>So total pets = C + (C +6) + (C -1) +2. Let's compute that again: C + C +6 + C -1 +2 = 3C +7.</p>
<p>But unless there's a numerical answer expected here, the problem might be missing some data. However, since it's a math problem, perhaps there is an implicit assumption that all variables result in positive integers. Let's check if 3C +7 is the total, and C must be such that S = C +6 ≥1, P = C -1 ≥0, and Dogs=2.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>S = C +6 ≥1 =&gt; C ≥ -5 (always true)</li>
<li>P = C -1 ≥0 =&gt; C ≥1</li>
<li>So minimal C is 2. Then total pets =3*2 +7=14.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, if we take C=1 (which gives P=0 invalid), but that's impossible.</p>
<p>If C=2, total pets=14. If C=3, total pets=21. So possible totals are 14 and 21.</p>
<p>But the problem says "how many pets does he have in total?" without giving any more constraints, so perhaps both are possible? But that seems unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake.</p>
<p>Wait, let me check once again:</p>
<p>He has six more snakes than cats. So if he has C cats, then snakes=6 more, so S=C+6.</p>
<p>Parrots are one less than cats: P = C -1.</p>
<p>Total pets: C + S + P + 2 dogs. So substituting:</p>
<p>C + (C+6) + (C -1) +2 = 3C +7.</p>
<p>So unless there's a specific number of cats, this is ambiguous. But the problem must have a unique answer. Therefore, perhaps I misread something.</p>
<p>Wait, going back to the problem: "He has six more snakes than he has cats." So S = C +6. Then, the rest: "&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think><br />
Okay, let's see. Frankie has some pets with different types: cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. The problem gives several relationships between their numbers and mentions that six of his pets have four legs, which means they are dogs. Then there's a total count to find.</p>
<p>First, let me list out what I know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frankie has six more snakes than cats.</li>
<li>He has one less parrot than cats.</li>
<li>Six of his pets have four legs, so they are dogs.</li>
<li>He has 2 dogs.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, starting with the number of cats. Let me denote the number of cats as C. Then snakes are six more than that: S = C + 6.</p>
<p>Parrots are one less than cats, so P = C - 1.</p>
<p>Dogs are given as two: D = 2.</p>
<p>Now, total pets would be C (cats) + S (snakes) + P (parrots) + D (dogs).</p>
<p>Simplify that: C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2.</p>
<p>Let me compute that step by step. Substitute C from the first equation into the second and third. Wait, actually, maybe I should express all in terms of C first.</p>
<p>So cats: C</p>
<p>Snakes: S = C + 6</p>
<p>Parrots: P = C - 1</p>
<p>Dogs: D = 2</p>
<p>Total pets: C + (C + 6) + (C - 1) + 2</p>
<p>Adding those up:</p>
<p>C + C + 6 + C - 1 + 2</p>
<p>Combine like terms: (1C + 1C + 1C) = 3C, then constants: 6 -1 +2 = 7</p>
<p>So total pets = 3C + 7</p>
<p>But we can't have negative snakes or parrots, so C has to be such that S and P are non-negative. So:</p>
<p>C + 6 ≥ 0 (snakes can't be negative) so C ≥ -6. Since we don't have any cats, probably positive.</p>
<p>Similarly, P = C - 1 ≥ 0 ⇒ C -1 ≥0 ⇒ C ≥1</p>
<p>So C must be at least 1.</p>
<p>But also, the total number of pets is 3C +7. The problem asks for the total number of pets, so we need to find a value of C that makes all counts positive and satisfies the given conditions.</p>
<p>Wait, but since Frankie has six more snakes than cats. If C is 1, then S =7. Then P=0 (since P=C-1=0). But Frankie can't have zero parrots. So C must be at least 2? Wait, because if C=1, P=0. If C=2, then S=8, P=1.</p>
<p>Wait, let's check:</p>
<p>If C=2:</p>
<p>Snakes: 8</p>
<p>Parrots: 1</p>
<p>Dogs:2</p>
<p>Total pets: 2+8+1+2=13</p>
<p>Wait, that seems okay.</p>
<p>But let's check if there is a minimal number of pets. The problem says Frankie has six more snakes than cats, so if C=1, S=7. So total pets would be 3<em>1 +7=10. But if C must be at least 2 (since P=C-1 can't be zero), then total pets would be 3</em>2 +7=13. So the minimal number of pets is 10? But maybe there's another condition.</p>
<p>Wait, but Frankie has six of his pets have four legs. The problem states that six of his pets have four legs, which is a separate condition. So even if there's no lower limit on the number of pets (other than C being at least 2), the six pets with four legs must include those dogs. Since we know he has two dogs, which are included in the six four-legged pets.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total number of pets is:</p>
<p>Total = 3C +7</p>
<p>But let's check whether all variables are non-negative. C must be at least 1, as P = C -1 ≥0 ⇒ C ≥1.</p>
<p>So if C=1:</p>
<p>S=7, P=0, D=2. But then Frankie has zero parrots, which is impossible because he can't have pets with photos on them. Wait, the problem says "he has one less parrot than cats." So if he can't have zero parrots, then C must be at least 2.</p>
<p>So with C=2:</p>
<p>S=8, P=1 (which is positive), D=2. So total pets:13.</p>
<p>But the problem doesn't specify that Frankie must have at least two cats. So the minimal number of pets is 13 (if C=2). But maybe there's another angle here. Wait, the problem says "He has six more snakes than he has cats." If C=1, then S=7. So total pets would be 10 (C + S + P + D) =1+7 +0 +2=10. But since Frankie can't have zero parrots, this is invalid. So C must be at least 2.</p>
<p>Therefore, the minimal possible total number of pets is 13. But maybe there's another constraint?</p>
<p>Wait, Frankie has two dogs. The problem says "six of his pets have four legs," which includes the dogs. So if he has two dogs, those are part of the six four-legged pets.</p>
<p>But in the minimal case (C=2), we have S=8, P=1, D=2. Total pets:13.</p>
<p>But maybe there is another way to model this? Let me check again.</p>
<p>Wait, the problem says "He has one less parrot than cats." So P = C -1. Therefore, if Frankie can't have a negative number of parrots, then C must be at least 1. But with C=1, P=0. If he can't have zero parrots, then C must be at least 2. Hence total pets would be 3C +7. With C=2, it's 13.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe there is a unique answer here. Wait, but let me check the numbers again.</p>
<p>Suppose C=2:</p>
<p>Cats:2</p>
<p>Snakes:S=8 (6 more than 2)</p>
<p>Parrots:P=1 (one less than 2)</p>
<p>Dogs:D=2</p>
<p>Total pets:2+8+1+2=13.</p>
<p>Six of his pets have four legs, which are the two dogs and four other animals? Wait, no. The problem says six of his pets have four legs. So those include the two dogs and possibly others. However, we don't know how many other four-legged pets he has.</p>
<p>But the problem only mentions that six of his pets have four legs. So maybe those could include some other animals, but since the problem doesn't specify, we can only use the given information. We know he has two dogs.</p>
<p>Therefore, if C=2 gives total pets 13, and another possible value is C=3:</p>
<p>C=3</p>
<p>Snakes:9 (6 more than 3)</p>
<p>Parrots:P=2</p>
<p>Total pets: C + S + P + D =3+9+2+2=16.</p>
<p>So there are multiple possible totals depending on C. But the problem is asking for "how many pets does he have in total?" Without additional constraints, there's not a unique answer. However, this seems unlikely because the problem is presented in a way that expects a specific number.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check again.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe I misrepresented the relationships. The problem says "He has six more snakes than he has cats." So S = C +6. That's correct.</p>
<p>"He has one less parrot than cats," so P = C -1. Correct.</p>
<p>Total pets: C + S + P + D = C + (C+6) + (C-1) + 2. Let's compute that:</p>
<p>C + C +6 + C -1 +2 = 3C +7. That's correct.</p>
<p>But the problem only gives that six of his pets have four legs, so D=2, and the rest don't. Therefore, unless there's another constraint, this seems like it can vary depending on C. Unless the problem implies that all pets are accounted for (which isn't stated) or if there's a lower bound.</p>
<p>But the problem doesn't specify any minimum number of pets. So unless there is an implicit assumption that all numbers (cats, snakes, parrots) are non-negative integers, which they are. So the possible numbers of pets would be 3C +7 for C ≥1 (since P=C-1 cannot be negative). But since the problem doesn't give a specific total, how can we answer?</p>
<p>Wait, maybe I misread the original problem. Let me check again.</p>
<p>Original problem:</p>
<p>"Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?"</p>
<p>So the key here is that Frankie has six more snakes than cats, one less parrot. The number of four-legged pets is six, which includes the two dogs and possibly others (since it's not specified how many four-legged pets are not dogs). But the problem doesn't mention any other four-legged animals, so those six include at least two dogs and possibly others. However, since we don't have information about the other four-legged pets (other than six in total), it's possible that those could be cats or some other animals. But since Frankie can't have snakes or par&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Frankie has various pets: cats, snakes, parrots, dogs, and some other ones with four legs. The question is asking how many pets he has in total.</p>
<p>First, I need to break down the information given. Let me start by writing down what I know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frankie has six more snakes than cats.</li>
<li>He has one less parrot than cats.</li>
<li>Six of his pets have four legs.</li>
<li>He has 2 dogs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hmm, so first, I need to figure out the number of each pet type. Let's start with snakes and cats because they relate directly to each other.</p>
<p>Let’s denote the number of cats as C. Then, according to the first point:</p>
<p>Number of snakes = Number of cats + 6</p>
<p>So if C is cats, then snakes would be C + 6.</p>
<p>Now, the second point says he has one less parrot than cats. So if the number of cats is C, then:</p>
<p>Number of parrots = Number of cats - 1</p>
<p>Which would be C - 1.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have expressions for snakes and parrots in terms of cats. Next, the third piece of information is that six of his pets have four legs. Since there are several types of pets, I need to consider which ones have four legs.</p>
<p>Common pets with four legs are dogs (they're mammals) and maybe cats or some reptiles? Wait, no. Cats have four legs too but they're predators. The problem mentions he has dogs and six of his pets have four legs. Wait, the question says "six of his pets have four legs." So, maybe there's a mix? But the problem doesn't specify which ones. Wait, but actually, dogs are mammals and typically have four legs. Maybe the four-legged pets include dogs and others? But the problem doesn't mention other types of animals except cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. Wait, maybe the six pets with four legs are a combination of his dogs and other animals? But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is confusing.</p>
<p>Wait, let me check again: "Six of his pets have four legs." So maybe all six are dogs? But the problem says he has 2 dogs. Wait, but if many pets have four legs, maybe it's a mix? But the problem doesn't specify. Wait, perhaps I need to assume that all four-legged pets are dogs? Because the problem mentions he has 2 dogs, but maybe there are more. However, the problem states that six of his pets have four legs. So unless specified otherwise, maybe all four-legged pets are dogs? Because if there were others, the problem would have mentioned them. For example, if there are other four-legged animals like hamsters or rabbits, but the problem doesn't mention them. Therefore, likely, the six pets with four legs are all dogs. Let's proceed under that assumption for now.</p>
<p>So if he has 2 dogs, and all six pets with four legs are dogs, then that's 6 animals (though he only has 2 dogs). Wait, no, each dog is one pet. So if six of his pets have four legs, and those are all dogs, then he has 6 four-legged animals, but only 2 of them are actual dogs. The other four would be something else? Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the six pets with four legs include not only dogs but also other animals. But the problem doesn't specify, so this might be a point of confusion.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe the six pets with four legs are all dogs. But then he would have 6 four-legged animals, but the problem only mentions 2 dogs. That can't be. Therefore, perhaps there are other animals that are four-legged but not dogs. The problem doesn't mention them, so maybe we need to consider that the six pets with four legs are a combination of dogs and other animals. But since we don't have info on others, perhaps the problem is intended to have all four-legged pets be dogs. Let me check again.</p>
<p>The problem says: "Six of his pets have four legs." It doesn't specify which ones, but since the only animals mentioned with specific numbers are snakes, cats, parrots, dogs. If he has six pets with four legs, and the only animals with four legs are maybe dogs, cats, but cats already have four legs. Wait, cats do have four legs, so if he has both dogs and cats with four legs, then the six pets with four legs would include some combination. But since he has 2 dogs and cats, but the problem doesn't say how many cats have four legs. Wait, this is getting complicated.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps the key here is that six of his pets have four legs, so regardless of other categories, that's 6 animals in total that are four-legged. So maybe those six include both dogs and other animals, but since we don't have info on others, perhaps all four-legged pets are dogs. But then if he has 2 dogs, those six would be the ones with four legs, but that doesn't add up. Therefore, maybe there's a mistake in my initial assumption.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the six pets with four legs are made up of dogs and cats. Let's think.</p>
<p>If he has C cats, then the number of cats with four legs would be C cats. He also has 2 dogs, so if the six pets with four legs include both cats and dogs, then total four-legged pets would be C + 2 = 6? Which would mean that he only has 4 four-legged pets (C + 2 = 6 implies C=4). But the problem says six of his pets have four legs, not that all six are four-legged. So maybe some animals are both four-legged and have other characteristics.</p>
<p>Wait, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to approach it step by step.</p>
<p>First, define variables:</p>
<p>Let C = number of cats</p>
<p>S = number of snakes</p>
<p>P = number of parrots</p>
<p>D = number of dogs (which is given as 2)</p>
<p>X = number of other pets with four legs. But the problem states "six of his pets have four legs," so maybe X is 6, but we don't know what type. However, since the other animals' numbers aren't given, perhaps all four-legged pets are dogs? But then X would be 6. However, if he has two dogs and six four-legged pets, that's impossible because there are only two. Therefore, maybe the six four-legged pets include other animals as well.</p>
<p>Wait, but we don't know anything about those other animals. The problem doesn't specify the types of pets besides cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. Therefore, perhaps we can assume that the six pets with four legs are a combination of dogs and other animals, but since we don't have information about them, maybe the problem is intended to only consider dogs among the four-legged ones. But that would mean that X = 6, but D=2, which contradicts.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the problem counts all animals with four legs regardless of type. So if there are six animals that have four legs, and those include dogs and cats, then:</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets = number of cats with four legs + number of dogs with four legs.</p>
<p>But we know he has 2 dogs, so if each dog is a pet, then the number of four-legged pets would be C (cats with four legs) + 2 (dogs). The problem states that six of his pets have four legs. So:</p>
<p>C + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Therefore, C = 4.</p>
<p>So the number of cats is 4. Then:</p>
<p>Snakes: S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10</p>
<p>Parrots: P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3</p>
<p>Dogs: D = 2 (given)</p>
<p>Now, total pets would be the sum of all these:</p>
<p>Cats: 4</p>
<p>Snakes:10</p>
<p>Parrots:3</p>
<p>Dogs:2</p>
<p>Total pets = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19</p>
<p>But wait, that includes the four-legged pets. Wait, no, because we calculated C as 4 based on the six four-legged pets (C + dogs =6, so 4 cats and 2 dogs). Then total pets are cats, snakes, parrots, dogs. But the problem says all six four-legged pets (which would be C + D =6, since cats and dogs are the only two-legged animals? Wait, no, that's not right. Cats have four legs too. So if a cat has four legs, then the six pets with four legs would include cats and dogs. Wait, but earlier we assumed that C + D =6 to get 4 cats and 2 dogs. But actually, if the six pets with four legs are both cats and dogs, then:</p>
<p>Number of cats with four legs = C</p>
<p>Number of dogs with four legs = D</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets = C + D =6</p>
<p>But we know that D=2. Therefore:</p>
<p>C + 2 =6 → C=4</p>
<p>So then total four-legged pets would be C + D =4 +2=6, which matches the problem statement. Therefore:</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets: 6</p>
<p>Cats:4</p>
<p>Dogs:2</p>
<p>Snakes:10</p>
<p>Parrots:3</p>
<p>Total pets: 4 +10 +3 +2 =19</p>
<p>So the answer is 19.</p>
<p>Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.</p>
<p>First, define C = cats</p>
<p>S=C +6 (snakes)</p>
<p>P=C -1 (parrots)</p>
<p>Six of his pets have four legs: cats and dogs. Therefore:</p>
<p>C + D =6 → if D&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Frankie has six more snakes than cats. Then he has one less parrot than the number of cats. Six pets have four legs, and there are 2 dogs. I need to find the total number of pets he has. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.</p>
<p>First, let me define variables for each type of pet. Let's say the number of cats Frankie has is 'c'. Then, according to the problem, he has six more snakes than that. So snakes would be 'c + 6'. </p>
<p>Next, he has one less parrot than the number of cats. Parrots would be 'c - 1'. Wait, that actually makes sense because if he has one less parrot than cats, then the number of parrots is cats minus one. So if there's 1 less than c, then it's c - 1.</p>
<p>Now, the problem mentions six pets have four legs. Since dogs are the only animals that have four legs (assuming others like snakes or parrots don't), and he has 2 dogs, that means the other six pets are not dogs. So those six must be cats or snakes? But wait, he already has c cats and c + 6 snakes. The total number of non-dog pets would be cats plus snakes, which is c + (c + 6) = 2c + 6. But the problem says six of his pets have four legs, and those are dogs plus something else. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.</p>
<p>Wait, the problem states that six of his pets have four legs. Since dogs are the only animals with four legs, then those six must be dogs and the rest would have other numbers of legs. So if he has 2 dogs, then the remaining six pets (four-legged) must be cats and snakes. But wait, he already has a certain number of each. Let me check again.</p>
<p>Wait, the problem says: "Six of his pets have four legs." So six of the total pets are dogs, and the rest (total number minus six) have other numbers of legs. But Frankie has cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. Let me verify each category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: c</li>
<li>Snakes: c + 6</li>
<li>Parrots: c - 1 (since he has one less than the number of cats)</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets = c + (c + 6) + (c - 1) + 2.</p>
<p>Let me compute that: c + c + 6 + c - 1 + 2 = 3c + 7.</p>
<p>But the problem says six of his pets have four legs. Since dogs are the only ones with four legs, then the 6 four-legged pets must be the two dogs plus something else. Wait, but if he has 2 dogs, then those six four-legged pets must be the six non-dog animals. But Frankie has cats, snakes, and parrots. So how does that add up?</p>
<p>Wait a second, maybe I need to clarify: the six pets with four legs are all dogs and the remaining ones? No, that can't be right. Because if he has 2 dogs, then the other six pets are not dogs. So those six must be cats or snakes. But according to his counts, he has c cats and c + 6 snakes. So the total number of non-dog pets is c (cats) + c + 6 (snakes). Let's compute that: 2c + 6.</p>
<p>But the problem states that six of his pets have four legs. So if all those six are dogs, then he must have 2 + 6 = 8 four-legged pets. But according to his animal counts, the total number of non-dog pets is 2c + 6. So if those six four-legged pets are all dogs, then the number of non-dog pets (cats and snakes) would be (2c + 6) - 8 = 2c - 2. But cats are c, and snakes are c + 6. So total non-dog pets would be c (cats) + (c + 6) = 2c + 6, which matches. So the six four-legged pets are all dogs? Wait, but that would mean Frankie has 2 + 6 = 8 four-legged pets. But he also has c cats and c + 6 snakes, which are not dogs. So the total four-legged pets would be dogs plus cats and snakes. Wait, but the problem says six of his pets have four legs, which would be dogs plus something else. But if he has 2 dogs, then the remaining six four-legged pets must be cats or snakes. But according to c + (c + 6) = 2c + 6, which is the total number of cats and snakes (non-dogs). So if six of those are four-legged, then the other six must be not four-legged. But dogs are the only ones with four legs. Therefore, all six non-dog pets must be not four-legged, which would mean that the 2 dogs are four-legged. So total four-legged pets are 8, which includes both cats and snakes having different numbers of legs. But the problem says six of his pets have four legs, so maybe all six are dogs? Wait, but that would mean he has 2 + 6 = 8 four-legged pets. But maybe not all six non-dog animals have different numbers of legs. Maybe some are four-legged and others aren't. Wait, this is confusing.</p>
<p>Let me approach this another way. Let's use the total number of pets and subtract the ones with four legs to find the non-four-legged. Total pets = 8 (since six have four legs, and 2 are dogs). Wait, hold on. If six pets have four legs (all dogs?), then total animals would be 8: 2 + 6. But Frankie has cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. So if he has six four-legged pets (all dogs), then the remaining two categories (cats, snakes, parrots) have 8 - 6 = 2 animals. But according to the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: c</li>
<li>Snakes: c + 6</li>
<li>Parrots: c - 1</li>
</ul>
<p>Total non-dog pets (cats and snakes) = 2c + 6 - c = c + 6. So he has c + 6 non-dog pets. But if the total number of animals is 8, then cats and snakes must sum to c + (c + 6) = 2c + 6. But the number of parrots is c - 1, and dogs are 2. So total pets: (c + 6) + (2) = c + 8. Therefore, total pets are c + 8. But we also know that the six four-legged pets (dogs) are equal to c + 6. Wait, this is getting tangled.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the six four-legged pets are dogs plus something else. Since the problem states that all six with four legs have them, then those six must be dogs. Therefore, the total number of animals is 2 (dogs) + c (cats) + (c + 6) (snakes) + (c - 1) (parrots). So total animals would be c + 2 + c + 6 + c -1. Let's compute that: 3c + 7.</p>
<p>But also, the problem says six of his pets have four legs (all dogs) and two dogs. So total animals would be c + 6. Wait, no. If the six four-legged pets are dogs, then total animals would be 2 dogs + c cats + (c + 6) snakes + (c -1) parrots. So total is c + 2 + c +6 + c -1 = 3c +7. But this contradicts with the four-legged pets being six (all dogs). Because if you have 2 dogs, then the rest of the animals must be non-dog. So total pets would be (total animals) = 2 dogs + c cats + (c +6) snakes + (c -1) parrots. So total animals would be 3c +7, but the four-legged ones are dogs, which is 2. Therefore, the number of non-dog pets (cats and snakes) would be 3c +7 -2 = 3c +5. But according to the problem, non-dog pets are cats plus snakes: c + (c +6) = 2c +6. So 3c +5 equals 2c +6? That can't be unless 3c -2c =1 =&gt; c=1. Then non-dog pets would be 1 +7=8, but according to the previous total animals (3c +7) with c=1 would be 10, but non-dog pets are 8. So this seems inconsistent.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the six four-legged pets are not all dogs. Maybe some of them are cats or snakes that have four legs, but that doesn't make sense because only dogs have four legs. So all six must be dogs.</p>
<p>Wait, unless the problem is saying that six of his total pets have four legs, regardless of type. So if he has 2 dogs, then the other six pets must have different numbers of legs. But those six would be cats and snakes, but they are not dogs. So total four-legged pets are two (dogs). But the problem states six have four legs, so that can't be. Therefore, there's a contradiction here.</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let me try to figure out how many pets Frankie has. Let's start by listing all the information given.</p>
<p>First, Frankie has six more snakes than cats. So if he has C cats, then the number of snakes S is C + 6. That seems straightforward.</p>
<p>Next, he has one less parrot than cats. So the number of parrots P is C - 1.</p>
<p>We also know that six pets have four legs. Hmm, dogs usually have four legs, right? So maybe those six pets are the dogs. But wait, Frankie has 2 dogs explicitly mentioned. That might be part of the six pets with four legs. Let me check.</p>
<p>If all six pets with four legs are dogs, then 2 of them should be accounted for. But wait, there might be more than one kind of pet with four legs. For example, cats and dogs both have four legs. So maybe Frankie has some cats with four legs? But he also has snakes and parrots, which don't count. Let me think.</p>
<p>Wait, the problem says six of his pets have four legs. So those six are all that matter for the leg count. Since dogs typically have four legs, and Frankie has 2 dogs, that would mean the remaining four of the six pets with four legs must be cats. Because if all dogs were accounted for, then the other four would have to be cats. That makes sense.</p>
<p>So if he has C cats, then the number of cats is C. If two of his pets are dogs (since 2 + C = 6), then the remaining four must be cats. So that gives us C = 4.</p>
<p>Let me confirm that. Let's go step by step.</p>
<ol>
<li>Total pets: S (snakes) + C (cats) + P (parrots) + D (dogs).</li>
</ol>
<p>But we don't know the total yet. Let's use the information step by step.</p>
<p>From the first two points:<br />
S = C + 6</p>
<p>P = C - 1</p>
<p>Given that six of his pets have four legs. As we established, these are cats and dogs. Since D = 2 (as given), then the remaining four must be cats, so C = 4. Therefore, S = 4 + 6 = 10.</p>
<p>Now we can find the number of parrots. P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.</p>
<p>So total pets would be:<br />
Snakes (10) + Cats (4) + Parrots (3) + Dogs (2) = 10 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.</p>
<p>Wait, let me check again. Wait, if C is cats and we found C = 4, then S = 10.</p>
<p>Dogs are 2, parrots are 3. So 4 + 3 = 7 cats and dogs with four legs, which sums to six. That works.</p>
<p>So total pets would be 10 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19. Hmm, but let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe the six pets with four legs are not necessarily cats and dogs. But since all mammals have four legs, the only other pets that could be mammals with four legs are cats and dogs. Since Frankie has 2 dogs, then the remaining four must be cats. So that's the only logical conclusion.</p>
<p>So total pets are 10 snakes + 4 cats + 3 parrots + 2 dogs = 19.</p>
<p>Wait, but let me cross-verify with another approach. Let's see:</p>
<p>From the definition of C and S:</p>
<p>S = C + 6</p>
<p>Total animals = S + C + P + D</p>
<p>But we don't know total, but from the legs:</p>
<p>6 pets have 4 legs: cats and dogs. So D = 2 (given), so C = 6 - D = 4, as before. So S = 4 + 6 = 10.</p>
<p>Total pets: 10 + 4 + (C -1) [since P = C -1] + D.</p>
<p>Wait, no. Wait, total pets are S + C + P + D. But we don't know total. However, from the legs: 6 pets have four legs (cats and dogs). So if C is cats, then C = number of cats. But we found that the total number of animals with four legs is 6, which are C (cats) and D (dogs). So C + D = 6. But since D is given as 2, then C must be 4.</p>
<p>Therefore, total pets are S (snakes) + C (cats) + P (parrots) + D (dogs). We know S = 10, C=4, P=3, D=2. So total is 19.</p>
<p>Wait, but let me check if there's another possible way. Suppose Frankie has other pets with four legs besides cats and dogs. But the problem states that six of his pets have four legs. Since he has 2 dogs, those are accounted for, so the remaining four must be cats. Therefore, C=4.</p>
<p>Alternatively, could it be that some of the other pets (snakes, parrots) have four legs? No, because snakes don't have legs, and parrots are birds. Only mammals (dogs and cats) have four legs here.</p>
<p>Therefore, the calculations seem correct. So total pets are 19.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
\boxed{19}</think></p>
<p>Frankie has six more snakes than cats, which means if he has ( C ) cats, the number of snakes is ( S = C + 6 ).</p>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots is ( P = C - 1 ).</p>
<p>Six of his pets have four legs. Since dogs typically have four legs, and Frankie has 2 dogs, the remaining four pets with four legs must be cats. Therefore, the number of cats ( C ) is 4.</p>
<p>Substituting ( C = 4 ) into the equations for snakes and parrots:<br />
- Snakes: ( S = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- Parrots: ( P = 4 - 1 = 3 )</p>
<p>The total number of pets is the sum of all animals: ( S + C + P + D ):<br />
- Dogs: ( D = 2 )</p>
<p>Calculating the total:<br />
[<br />
10 \text{ (snakes)} + 4 \text{ (cats)} + 3 \text{ (parrots)} + 2 \text{ (dogs)} = 19<br />
]</p>
<p>Thus, the total number of pets Frankie has is (\boxed{19}).&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's try to figure out how many pets Frankie has. The problem says he has six more snakes than cats, one less parrot than cats, so we need to find out how many of each he has. Then we can add them all up to get the total.</p>
<p>First, let's break down the information step by step. The key points here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Snakes = Cats + 6</li>
<li>Parrots = Cats - 1</li>
<li>Dogs = 2 (are given directly)</li>
<li>Total legs of pets with four legs = 6</li>
<li>Each dog has 4 legs, so two dogs would have 8 legs.</li>
<li>We need to find the number of each pet (snakes, cats, parrots) to answer the question.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me start by assigning a variable to the number of cats. Let's say the number of cats is C. Then, according to the first point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snakes = Cats + 6<br />
So snakes (S) would be C + 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second point tells us that parrots are one less than cats, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parrots (P) = Cats - 1<br />
Therefore, P = C - 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we know the number of dogs is 2. Since each dog has 4 legs, the total legs from dogs would be:</p>
<p>Total dog legs = 2 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 8 legs.</p>
<p>So far, the total legs we have accounted for are from dogs and snakes. Let's add those up.</p>
<p>But wait, the problem also mentions that six of his pets have four legs. So total legs from all four-legged pets (including dogs, snakes, maybe cats?) would be 6. Let me confirm:</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets = number of dogs + number of snakes.</p>
<p>But wait, the problem says six of his pets have four legs. It doesn't specify which ones. But since dogs are already counted, and snakes can also be four-legged if they have legs, but maybe snakes don't have legs? Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me check the problem again.</p>
<p>"Six of his pets have four legs." So six pets in total have four legs. That includes dogs and maybe other quadrupeds like cats, snakes, or even parrots if they have four legs. But Frankie's pets are animals like cats, snakes, dogs, parrots. Dogs definitely have four legs. Cats usually have four legs too, but snakes... Hmm, do snakes have legs? Some snakes are limbless, like pythons. So maybe Frankie's snakes don't have legs, so they wouldn't contribute to the four-legged count. So then the six pets with four legs would have to be dogs and cats?</p>
<p>Wait, but let's think again. If Frankie has snakes, then unless those are pet pythons (which sometimes have legs), but generally, snakes don't. So maybe the six four-legged pets are dogs and cats. Therefore, total four-legged pets would be 2 (dogs) + number of cats with legs. So if C is the number of cats with four legs, then total four-legged pets would be 2 + C. Then the problem says six of his pets have four legs, so:</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets = 2 dogs + number of cats with legs = 6</p>
<p>But wait, the problem says "six of his pets have four legs." So exactly six pets in total have four legs. But the problem doesn't specify which ones, but since we need to find all pets, including those with four legs. So the total number of pets would be dogs (2) + snakes (C+6) + cats (number with legs, let's say C_legs) + parrots (C-1). But maybe the four-legged pets are only dogs and cats. So total four-legged would be 2 + C_legs =6, so C_legs=4. Therefore, cats have four legs, so all six pets with four legs are dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 dogs</li>
<li>C cats (with four legs)</li>
<li>S snakes = C +6</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the total number of pets would be dogs (2) + cats (C) + snakes (S) = 2 + C + (C+6) = 8 + 2C.</p>
<p>But we need to find the total number of pets, which is 8 + 2C. However, we need to find the values of C (number of cats), S (snakes), and P (parrots). To find these, we need to use the other given information.</p>
<p>Wait, let's recap:</p>
<p>We have:</p>
<ol>
<li>S = C +6</li>
<li>P = C -1</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
<li>Total four-legged pets:6<br />
   So, dogs (2) + cats with legs =4</li>
</ol>
<p>But wait, the problem says six of his pets have four legs. So total four-legged is 6. Therefore:</p>
<p>Total quadruped pets (dogs and cats with legs) =6</p>
<p>But dogs are 2, so the rest of the four-legged pets are cats with legs. So:</p>
<p>Number of cats with legs =6 -2=4</p>
<p>Therefore, all the six pets with four legs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 dogs</li>
<li>4 cats</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, number of cats total is the same as cats with legs (since all snakes don't have legs). So:</p>
<p>C =4</p>
<p>Therefore, number of cats is 4.</p>
<p>Then snakes would be C +6=4+6=10</p>
<p>Parrots are C -1=4-1=3</p>
<p>So now we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats:4</li>
<li>Snakes:10</li>
<li>Parrots:3</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus dogs, which are 2. Total pets=4+10+3+2=19</p>
<p>Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.</p>
<p>If Frankie has 4 cats (all with four legs), then snakes are 10, parrots 3. Dogs are 2 each: total of 6 four-legged pets (4 cats + 2 dogs). Then total pets would be 10+3+2=15? Wait, no:</p>
<p>Wait, cats are 4. So cats with legs: all 4. Then dogs:2, snakes:10 (which don't have legs). Therefore total four-legged pets:4+2=6. Then total pets would be 4 cats +10 snakes +3 parrots +2 dogs=19. Yes, that adds up.</p>
<p>But let me check again step by step:</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ol>
<li>S = C +6 (snakes)</li>
<li>P = C -1 (parrots)</li>
<li>Dogs=2</li>
<li>Total four-legged pets:6</li>
</ol>
<p>From point 4, total four-legged pets= dogs + cats with legs. Since we know all six are accounted for by dogs and cats, so:</p>
<p>2 (dogs) + number of cats with legs =6 → number of cats with legs=4. So all 4 cats have legs.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cats: C =4</li>
<li>Snakes:S=4+6=10</li>
<li>Parrots:P=4-1=3</li>
</ul>
<p>Total pets: C +S +P +Dogs=4+10+3+2=19</p>
<p>Yes, that seems correct.</p>
<p>But let me check if the parrots have legs. The problem doesn't specify, but since Frankie has a pet parrot, it's probably a normal bird with two legs. So parrots do have four legs. Therefore, all counts are correct.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total number of pets is 19.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
\boxed{19}</think></p>
<p>Frankie has six more snakes than cats, one less parrot than cats, and 2 dogs. The problem also states that six of his pets have four legs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Let ( C ) be the number of cats.</li>
<li>Snakes (( S )) are given by ( S = C + 6 ).</li>
<li>Parrots (( P )) are given by ( P = C - 1 ).</li>
<li>Dogs (( D )) are directly given as 2.</li>
<li>The total number of pets with four legs is six. Since dogs have 4 legs each, the remaining four-legged pets are cats.</li>
</ol>
<p>We know:<br />
- The number of dogs is 2.<br />
- The total number of pets with four legs (cats and dogs) is 6.</p>
<p>Thus, the total number of cats with four legs is:<br />
[ 4 \text{ (since } 6 - 2 = 4) ]</p>
<p>Therefore, the number of cats (( C )) is 4. This means:<br />
- Snakes (( S )) are ( 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- Parrots (( P )) are ( 4 - 1 = 3 )</p>
<p>Adding all the pets together:<br />
[ \text{Total number of pets} = C + S + P + D = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19 ]</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Frankie has different types of pets: snakes, cats, parrots, and dogs. The problem is asking for the total number of pets he has. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.</p>
<p>First, the problem states that Frankie has six more snakes than cats. So if I let the number of cats be a variable, say 'c', then the number of snakes would be c + 6. That makes sense because he has six more snakes than cats.</p>
<p>Next, it says he has one less parrot than cats. So the number of parrots would be c - 1. Got that.</p>
<p>Then, there's a part about six of his pets having four legs and two dogs. Wait, the question is asking for the total number of pets, so I need to figure out how many four-legged animals there are among all the pets and then add that to the number of dogs.</p>
<p>First, let me note down what I know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let c = number of cats</li>
<li>Snakes: c + 6</li>
<li>Parrots: c - 1 (since one less than cats)</li>
<li>Dogs: 2</li>
<li>Six pets have four legs, but this is probably referring to some combination of the other animals. Wait, the problem says "Six of his pets have four legs." So out of all his pets (snakes, cats, parrots, dogs), six of them are four-legged animals. So we need to find that number.</li>
</ul>
<p>But how do I combine the information? Let's see.</p>
<p>We have cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. The six four-legged pets are from these categories.</p>
<p>But the problem doesn't specify how many cats, snakes, or parrots have four legs. So I need to figure out the total number of animals and then see how many are four-legged.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe we can express everything in terms of c and then work backwards. Let me try that.</p>
<p>Total number of pets = cats + snakes + parrots + dogs</p>
<p>Which is c + (c + 6) + (c - 1) + 2</p>
<p>Simplify that:</p>
<p>c + c + 6 + c - 1 + 2 = 3c + 7</p>
<p>So total pets would be 3c + 7. Hmm, okay.</p>
<p>But the problem mentions six of his pets have four legs. So if we add up all the cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs, six of them are four-legged. Therefore, total animals = 3c + 7, and six of those have four legs.</p>
<p>So we need to find c such that when we add up the number of cats, snakes, and parrots (each with their four-legged count), plus two dogs, the total is 6.</p>
<p>But how do we figure out which pets have four legs? The problem doesn't specify. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe there's an assumption here that all pets are either four-legged or not. But the problem says six of his pets have four legs, which are some combination of cats, snakes, parrots, and dogs. We need to find a value for c where six of the total animals are four-legged.</p>
<p>But without additional information, how can we determine c? The answer must be solvable with the given information, so maybe there's a way to figure out c without knowing which pets are four-legged.</p>
<p>Wait, but actually, if we can express the number of four-legged animals in terms of c, maybe that's possible. Let me think.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to realize that all four-legged animals are cats? But that might not be necessarily true. The problem doesn't specify, so we can't assume.</p>
<p>Wait, but maybe the question is designed such that even without knowing which specific pets are four-legged, the total number can be deduced. Let's check.</p>
<p>If we let T = total pets = 3c + 7</p>
<p>And among these, six are four-legged. So:</p>
<p>Number of four-legged pets = cats + snakes with four legs + parrots with four legs + dogs with four legs</p>
<p>But since all the animals are either cats, snakes, parrots, or dogs, and we don't know which of these have four legs, this is a problem. Unless the question is assuming that all cats are four-legged and others aren't, but that's not stated.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps there is a standard assumption here. For example, in such problems, usually snakes and parrots are non-four-legged unless specified otherwise. But since the problem doesn't mention that, maybe we need to check.</p>
<p>Wait, actually, let's re-examine the problem statement:</p>
<p>"Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs."</p>
<p>So Frankie has six four-legged animals in total, and two dogs among them. The rest of the pets (snakes, cats, parrots) are non-four-legged? Or some combination?</p>
<p>But since we don't know, maybe the problem expects us to consider that among cats and dogs, how many four-legged pets there are. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify.</p>
<p>This is confusing. Maybe there's a trick here. Let me try to approach this differently.</p>
<p>Let me consider that the six four-legged pets are a combination of cats and dogs. But how?</p>
<p>Wait, if we assume that all cats are four-legged and the rest are non-four-legged (snakes and parrots), then the number of four-legged pets would be c + 2. But that's not necessarily stated.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the problem implies that all cats have four legs and the others don't. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that all four-legged pets are cats and dogs. Let's see.</p>
<p>But according to the problem, Frankie has six four-legged pets. If he has 2 dogs, then the remaining four pets with four legs must be cats. So c = 6 - 2 + 1? Wait, no.</p>
<p>Wait, if dogs have four legs and cats also have four legs, then total four-legged pets would be cats + dogs. But the problem says "six of his pets have four legs". So if two are dogs, then four are cats. But the problem doesn't specify how many of each.</p>
<p>Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Let me check the original problem again:</p>
<p>"Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?"</p>
<p>So, rephrasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snakes = cats + 6</li>
<li>Parrots = cats - 1</li>
<li>Dogs = 2 (since Frankie has 2 dogs)</li>
<li>Total pets: cats + snakes + parrots + dogs</li>
<li>Six of his pets have four legs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to find the number of pets, but we don't know how many cats have four legs. So unless there's a missing piece of information, maybe the answer is supposed to be in terms of c, but the question asks for a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that all cats have four legs and the other pets don't.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe the question is structured so that only cats have four legs. Then:</p>
<p>Total pets = c + (c + 6) + (c - 1) + 2</p>
<p>Which is c<em>(3) +7. If the six four-legged pets are all cats, then total animals = 6</em>4 + 2*2 = 24 + 4 = 28? Wait, but that might not be the case.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if all four-legged pets are cats and dogs:</p>
<p>Number of cats with four legs: c</p>
<p>Number of dogs with four legs: 2 (since they are dogs)</p>
<p>Total four-legged pets: c + 2</p>
<p>But the problem states six of his pets have four legs, which would be:</p>
<p>c + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Therefore, c = 4. Then total pets would be:</p>
<p>c + (c +6) + (c -1) + 2 = c + c +6 + c -1 +2 = 3c +7</p>
<p>If c=4, then total pets = 12 +7=19. But this is assuming all four-legged pets are cats and dogs, which may not be the case.</p>
<p>But since the problem doesn't specify how many four-legged pets there are, this is just a guess. However, the problem must have a unique solution, so perhaps there's another way.</p>
<p>Wait, maybe the six four-legged animals are exactly six of the pets: cats + dogs = 6. Then:</p>
<p>c + 2 = 6</p>
<p>Therefore, c=4. Then total pets:</p>
<p>Frankie has 4 cats + (4+6)=10 snakes + (4-1)=9 parrots + 2 dogs. Total pets: 4+10+9+2=25.</p>
<p>But does this make sense? If six of his pets have four legs, and two are dogs (which also have four legs), then the cats would need to be 4. But why would all cats be four-legged if some are not? The problem doesn't state that.</p>
<p>Alternatively, maybe the six four-legged pets are a combination of cats and other animals. But since we don't have information on how many four-legged snakes or parrots there are, this is impossible to determine.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, but maybe the problem expects us to realize that all four-legged pets are dogs and cats. Since two of them are dogs, the remaining six must be cats. So c=6-2=4. Then total pets:</p>
<p>c + (c+6) + (c-1) +2 =4 +10 +9 +2=25. But again, the problem doesn't&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>

<p>Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?&lt;|eot_id|&gt;&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;</p>
<p><think>Okay, let's see. Frankie has a bunch of pets: snakes, cats, parrots. The problem gives some relationships between them and asks for the total number. Hmm. Let me start breaking it down step by step.</p>
<p>First, the problem says he has six more snakes than cats. So if I let the number of cats be a variable, maybe C, then the number of snakes would be C + 6. But wait, is that right? No, actually, it's the other way around. If he has six more snakes than cats, then the number of snakes is cats plus six. Yes, that makes sense. So S = C + 6, where S is snakes and C is cats.</p>
<p>Next, he has one less parrot than cats. So if the number of cats is C, then the number of parrots would be C - 1. So P = C - 1, where P is parrots.</p>
<p>Now, the problem also mentions six of his pets have four legs. Wait, that doesn't make sense. All dogs and cats usually have four legs each. If six pets have four legs, that means the rest must be something else without legs? Or maybe maybe all his pets except six. Wait, but the problem also mentions he has 2 dogs. Dogs have four legs each, so if two of his pets are dogs, then total number of legged pets would be 2 dogs plus the six with four legs. But wait, that's a problem because the "six of his pets have four legs" would include both dogs and cats. But hold on, maybe the six with four legs are just cats? But wait, no, because he has dogs as well. Let me think.</p>
<p>Wait, if six of his pets have four legs, that would be cats and dogs. But he has two dogs, so those two dogs have four legs each. Then the remaining four-legged pets would be cats. So how many cats does he have? Let me check that again.</p>
<p>Wait, the problem says six of his pets have four legs. If he has two dogs, then those are part of the six with four legs. So the total number of cats would be the remaining legged pets, which is six minus two equals four? Wait, but maybe not. Let me parse this carefully.</p>
<p>The problem states: "Six of his pets have four legs." So regardless of the type, six pets total have four legs. But since he has dogs and cats, which both have four legs, those two dogs are among the six. Therefore, the other four-legged pets must be cats, and there would be four cats. Then, the total number of legged pets is six (cats) plus two dogs equals eight? Wait, no. Wait, the six with four legs include both cats and dogs. The number of cats is equal to the remaining legged pets after subtracting dogs. Since he has two dogs, the number of cats would be six minus two equals four? Wait, that can't be. Because if he has four cats, each with four legs, and two dogs, then total legged pets would be six. So the math checks out.</p>
<p>But wait, if he has four cats and two dogs, that's six pets with four legs. So the number of cats is four, parrots are one less than cats (so three parrots), and snakes are six more than cats (so eight snakes). Then, the total number of pets would be 4 + 3 + 8 = 15. Let me check if that adds up.</p>
<p>Wait, let's verify again step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cats (C) = C</li>
<li>Snakes (S) = C + 6</li>
<li>Parrots (P) = C - 1</li>
</ol>
<p>Total pets: S + P + C = (C + 6) + (C - 1) + C</p>
<p>Let me compute that:</p>
<p>(C + 6) + (C - 1) + C = (C + C + C) + (6 - 1)</p>
<p>= 3C + 5</p>
<p>So total pets are 3C + 5.</p>
<p>But we need another equation to solve for C. Wait, the problem gives that six of his pets have four legs. So total legged pets are cats + dogs. Wait, but he has two dogs and some number of cats. But the six with four legs include both cats and dogs, right? Because six total have four legs. So if he has two dogs, each with four legs, then the remaining four-legged pets are cats. So number of cats is six minus two equals four? Wait, no. If he has six pets with four legs, and among those six are two dogs, then the remaining four-legged pets are cats. So number of cats = 6 - 2 = 4.</p>
<p>Therefore, C = 4. Then:</p>
<p>S = C + 6 = 10</p>
<p>P = C -1 = 3</p>
<p>Total pets: S + P + C = 10 + 3 + 4 = 17.</p>
<p>Wait, so is the total number of pets 17? Let me check again.</p>
<p>Cats: 4</p>
<p>Snakes: 10 (since 4 +6 =10)</p>
<p>Parrots: 3 (since 4 -1=3)</p>
<p>Total: 17. That seems right. Let me verify the four-legged pets: dogs are two, cats plus dogs total six with four legs. 4 cats +2 dogs=6 pets with four legs. That's correct.</p>
<p>Is there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, maybe the six with four legs are only cats. But if there were no dogs, then six cats would have four legs, but he has two dogs. So that interpretation doesn't hold. Therefore, the six must include both cats and dogs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total number of pets is 17. So the answer should be \boxed{17}.</p>
<p>Wait, but let me check once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations.</p>
<p>Let me redo the equations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Let C = number of cats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S = C +6 (snakes are six more than cats)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P = C -1 (parrots are one less than cats)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Total pets: S + P + C = (C +6) + (C -1) + C</p>
<p>= 3C +5</p>
<p>Number of legged pets: cats (which includes P and the two dogs) would be C +2 (since he has two dogs). But according to the problem, six of his pets have four legs. So C +2 =6. Therefore, solving for C:</p>
<p>C +2=6 =&gt; C=4</p>
<p>Therefore, total pets: 3*4 +5 =12 +5=17. Yes, same result.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total number of pets is 17. So the answer is \boxed{17}.</p>
<p><strong>Final Answer</strong><br />
The total number of pets Frankie has is \boxed{17}.</think></p>
<p>Frankie has six more snakes than cats. Let ( C ) be the number of cats. Then, the number of snakes is ( S = C + 6 ).</p>
<p>He has one less parrot than cats, so let ( P ) be the number of parrots. Then, the number of parrots is ( P = C - 1 ).</p>
<p>The problem states that six of his pets have four legs. This includes the number of dogs and cats. Since he has 2 dogs, the remaining four-legged pets are ( C ) (cats). Therefore, we have:<br />
[<br />
C + 2 = 6<br />
]<br />
Solving this equation gives ( C = 4 ).</p>
<p>Now, we calculate the total number of pets:<br />
- Number of cats: ( C = 4 )<br />
- Number of snakes: ( S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 )<br />
- Number of parrots: ( P = C - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 )</p>
<p>Adding these together:<br />
[<br />
S + P + C = 10 + 3 + 4 = 17<br />
]</p>
<p>Thus, the total number of pets Frankie has is (\boxed{17}).&lt;|eot_id|&gt;</p>
